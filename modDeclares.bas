' Here are all the API calls in the program, with their public
' constants, explained as best as I can.

Option Explicit

' Rectangle
' An API call for drawing rectangles. The style of the rectangle is decided by the form's
' (or picture object's, or any object with an hDC) drawing styles, such as FillColor,
' ForeColor and FillStyle. One of the most useful API calls, but why didn't they just use
' a RECT variable?
Public Declare Function Rectangle Lib "gdi32" (ByVal hdc As Long, ByVal X1 As Long, _
    ByVal Y1 As Long, ByVal X2 As Long, ByVal Y2 As Long) As Long

' DrawEdge
' An API call for drawing those nasty 3D borders, very flat borders, or in some cases
' those attractive one-pixel borders. This is also the nastiest API call I know to include
' constants for.
' Remember that comment about "Calculates space left over"? That was for a flag
' called BF_ADJUST that goes with DrawEdge, not DT_CALCRECT for DrawText! Many
' apologies to Ariad Software, but that brief description is still useless.
Public Declare Function DrawEdge Lib "user32" (ByVal hdc As Long, qrc As RECT, _
    ByVal edge As Long, ByVal grfFlags As Long) As Long

' DrawState
' An API call for drawing pictures in a certain state. It can be used to draw disabled
' icons, selected icons or icons in a single colour.

' object.

' DrawText
' An API call for drawing text. It uses the ForeColor property of the object to
' determine the colour of the text. To draw disabled text you will need to use the
' DrawStateString API call.
