Hey Planet Source Code user, it's Andrew (The Bad One) here.

Don't forget that I am in desperate need for MIDI and WAV files to use in my new and largest project. If you have any original compositions (ie. not from existing games), or know where to get some from, please write to badhart@hotpop.com with the subject "Real Fantasy". Everybody who contributes will be acknowledged!

If you like the source code and/or the control by the way, a vote or comment would be appreciated. Flaming won't be appreciated and will earn you a slap - I've had enough of those. Flames that is.

If you know how to use "memory bitmaps" (ie. ones that don't use a picture control), or know how to create masks of images really quickly, please let me know.
